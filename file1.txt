growing up away from all that until he’
s ready to take
it?”
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her
mind, swallowed, and then said, “Y
es — yes, you’re
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here,
Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though
she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
“Hagrid’
s bringing him.”
“Y
ou think it — 
wise
 — to trust Hagrid with
something as important as this?”

“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not saying his heart isn’
t in the right place,” said
Professor McGonagall grudgingly
, “but you can’
t
pretend he’
s not careless. He does tend to — what
was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and
down the street for some sign of a headlight; it
www.ztcprep.com
swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky —
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed
on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a
normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked
simply too big to be allowed, and so 
wild
 — long
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his
feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In
his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of
blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At
last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir
,” said the
giant, climbing carefully of
f the motorcycle as he
spoke. “Y
oung Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him,
sir
.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him
www.ztcprep.com
out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’
around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”

Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a
baby boy
, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped
cut, like a bolt of lightning.
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Y
es,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever
.”
“Couldn’
t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”
“Even if I could, I wouldn’
t. Scars can come in handy
.
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect
map of the London Under
ground. W
ell — give him
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned
toward the Dursleys’ house.
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked
Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry
www.ztcprep.com
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy
,
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly
, Hagrid let out a howl
like a wounded dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the
Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry
,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a lar
ge, spotted
handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-
can’
t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little
Harry of
f ter live with Muggles —”
“Y
es, yes, it’
s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself,
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall
whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and
walked to the front door
. He laid Harry gently on the

doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’
s blankets,
and then came back to the
other two. For a full minute the three of them stood
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’
s shoulders
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously
, and
www.ztcprep.com
the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore’
s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“W
ell,” said Dumbledore finally
, “that’
s that. W
e’ve no
business staying here. W
e may as well go and join the
celebrations.”
“Y
eah,” said Hagrid in a very muf
fled voice, “I’d best
get this bike away
. G’night, Professor McGonagall —
Professor Dumbledore, sir
.”
W
iping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and of
f
into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,”
said Dumbledore, nodding to her
. Professor
McGonagall blew her nose in reply
.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-
Outer
. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a
www.ztcprep.com
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets
on the step of number four
.
“Good luck, Harry
,” he murmured. He turned on his
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.
A breeze ruf
fled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky
, the very last
P a g e

place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without
waking up. One small hand closed on the letter
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was
special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he
would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs.
Dursley’
s scream as she opened the front door to put
out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin
Dudley
. … He couldn’
t know that at this very
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country

were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed
voices: “T
o Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

THE V
ANASHIG GLASS
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into
their living room, which was almost exactly the same
as it had been on the night when Mr
. Dursley had
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how
www.ztcprep.com
much time had passed. T
en years ago, there had been
lots of pictures of what looked like a lar
ge pink beach
ball wearing dif
ferent-colored bonnets — but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby
, and now the
photographs showed a lar
ge blond boy riding his first
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair
, playing a computer
game with his father
, being hugged and kissed by his
mother
. The room held no sign at all that another boy
lived in the house, too.
Y
et Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment,
but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it

was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day
.
“Up! Get up! Now!”
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door
again.
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan
being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and
www.ztcprep.com
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It
had been a good one. There had been a flying
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the
same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door
.
“Are you up yet?” she demanded.
“Nearly
,” said Harry
.
“W
ell, get a move on, I want you to look after the
bacon. And don’
t you dare let it burn, I want
everything perfect on Duddy’
s birthday
.”
Harry groaned.
“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the
door
.
“Nothing, nothing …”
Dudley’
s birthday — how could he have for
gotten?
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for
socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after
pulling a spider of
f one of them, put them on. Harry
was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the
kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all
Dudley’
s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not
to mention the second television and the racing bike.
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry
, as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercise — unless of course it involved punching
somebody
. Dudley’
s favorite punching bag was Harry
,
but he couldn’
t often catch him. Harry didn’
t look it,
but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and
skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to
wear were old clothes of Dudley’
s, and Dudley was
about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair
, and bright green
