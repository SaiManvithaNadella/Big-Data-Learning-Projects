about you stumped him, all right.”
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect
blazing in his eyes, but Harry
, instead of feeling
pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a
horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he
possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by
Dudley
, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle
V
ernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’
t they
been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried
to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the
greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had
always been able to kick him around like a football?
“Hagrid,” he said quietly
, “I think you must have
made a mistake. I don’
t think I can be a wizard.”
T
o his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when
you was scared or angry?”
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think
about it … every odd thing that had ever made his
aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when

he, Harry
, had been upset or angry … chased by
Dudley’
s gang, he had somehow found himself out of
their reach … dreading going to school with that
ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow
back … and the very last time Dudley had hit him,

hadn’
t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’
t he
set a boa constrictor on him?
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that
Hagrid was positively beaming at him.
“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter
, not a wizard — you
wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”
But Uncle V
ernon wasn’
t going to give in without a
fight.
“Haven’
t I told you he’
s not going?” he hissed. “He’
s
going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve
read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish —
spell books and wands and —”
“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’
t stop
him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter

“I AM NOT P

But he had finally gone too far
. Hagrid seized his
umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he
thundered, “— INSUL
T — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE
— IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the
air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet
light, a sound like a firecracker
, a sharp squeal, and

pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a
curly pig’
s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.
Uncle V
ernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and
Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified
look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his
beard.
“Shouldn’
ta lost me temper
,” he said ruefully
, “but it
didn’
t work anyway
. Meant ter turn him into a pig,
but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there
wasn’
t much left ter do.”
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy
eyebrows.
“Be grateful if yeh didn’
t mention that ter anyone at
Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do
magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter
follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuf

the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —”
“Why aren’

man, Dumbledore.”
“Why were you expelled?”
“It’
s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow

said Hagrid loudly
. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer
books an’ that.”

He took of

“Y

wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in

Harry woke early the next morning. Although he
could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly
. “I dreamed a
giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a
school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at
home in my cupboard.”
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
And ther

sinking. But he still didn’

“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”
He sat up and Hagrid’

himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there

was an owl rapping its claw on the window
, a
newspaper held in its beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as
though a lar
ge balloon was swelling inside him. He
went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of
Hagrid, who didn’
t wake up. The owl then fluttered
onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’
s coat.
“Don’
t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way
, but it
snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on
savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly
. “There’
s an owl —”
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
“What?”
“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper
. Look in the
pockets.”
Hagrid’
s coat seemed to be made of nothing 
but

pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of
string, peppermint humbugs, teabags … finally
, Harry
pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily
.
“Knuts?”
“The little bronze ones.”
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl
held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a
P a g e

small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew of
f
through the open window
.
Hagrid yawned loudly
, sat up, and stretched.
“Best be of
f, Harry
, lots ter do today
, gotta get up ter
London an’ buy all yer stuf
f fer school.”
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking
at them. He had just thought of something that made
him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had
got a puncture.
“Um — Hagrid?”

“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge
boots.
“I haven’
t got any money — and you heard Uncle
V
ernon last night … he won’
t pay for me to go and
learn magic.”
“Don’
t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up
and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents
didn’
t leave yeh anything?”
“But if their house was destroyed —”
“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah,
first stop fer us is Gringotts. W

sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no

“W

“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

“He usually gets me ter do important stuf

“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was
quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.
The boat Uncle V
ernon had hired was still there, with
a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around
for another boat.
“Flew

“

“Y
